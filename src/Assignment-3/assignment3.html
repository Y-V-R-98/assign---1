				<h1>Your Best Value Proposition</h1>
				<p id=some-text>
					Not quite a slogan, not quite a mission statement; a value proposition is your chance to tell your
					target market what makes you better than everyone else.
					Your value proposition brings together your customers’ wants, needs, and fears with your product’s
					benefits and features. But your value prop shouldn’t just be a list of features… It needs to be
					excellent copywriting that captures your audience’s attention, using their language and tells them in a
					few short, simple phrases why they should buy from you rather than your competitors.
					A great or poor value proposition can be the key decider in whether a customer will dive deeper into
					your website or hit the “back” button, so it’s vital you get this right.
